This arithmetic progression starts at 0.1, the common difference of successive members is determined randomly from the list [0.15,-0.15], and has size of 14 elements (as the number of notes in the melody). The random selection of the difference of successive members results with an arithmetic progression which is not typical since the difference may vary between each 2 successive members, and thus we might not get a trend of consistent increasement or consistent decreasement.
